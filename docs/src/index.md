`MatrixOptim.jl` is a package to model and solve optimization in uncertain context. The
templates for robust optimization and stochastic optimization formulated in matrix are very
coherent comprehensive, and the algorithms in matrix are very explicit.

This is a package I developed in 2019. Don't know too much about tests and documentation
that time. I am trying to keep it up-to-date these days.

```@meta
CurrentModule = MatrixOptim
```

```@autodocs
Modules = [MatrixOptim]
Order = [:function, :type]
```
